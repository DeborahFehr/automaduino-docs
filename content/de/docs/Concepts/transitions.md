### Overview

![](/docs/tutorials/blink-transitions.png)
_Example of transitions in the [Blink Program](/docs/getting-started/blink/)._

Transitions connect states. After the code in the state has been executed a transition describes how we move on to the next state. The _then_ and _delay_ transition are available for all types of components, while the _if_, _ifelse_ and _cond_ transitions are only available for user input and sensor components. The later three depend on the input generated by the component.

### Available Transitions

#### then

_then example_

A then transition immediatly moves on to the next state.

#### delay

_delay transition example_

A delay transition waits for a specified number of milliseconds before moving to the next state. 


#### if

![](/docs/tutorials/falls.png)

_if transition example_

An if transition will only move on to the next state if a condition is met, if not it will remain in the current state. This is useful for sensors. 

#### if else

![](/docs/tutorials/oder.png)

_If Else transition example_

An if else transition will only move on to the next state if a condition is met, if not it will move on to a different state. This is useful for user input components. 


#### cond

_Cond transition example_

A cond transition will move to different states depending on the input. This makes sense for sensors with analog output as we can define different action depending on the resulting value.
