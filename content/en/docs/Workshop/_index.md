Autmaduino was tested in a 3 day workshop in April 2022. For this I created workshop materials including presentations, work sheets and cheat sheets. The material is designed for beginners. **Day 1** introduces the basic Arduino features and introduces Automaduino. **Day 2** features the input and output components and introduces more complex transitions. **Day 3** is about the transition to textbased programming. Finally there is a **quiz** to test your knowledge.
