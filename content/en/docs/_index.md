Learn how to start with Automaduino!
{{% /pageinfo %}}


Automaduino is a visual programming language using finite state automata for the Arduino. The goal of this project is to determine whether a language like Automaduino achieves better results compared to a interlocking block language like blockly when used in teaching. You can use the [Online Editor](https://app.automaduino.com/) to try it out and generate code without having to code a single line. It currently supports 15 basic components.

## Installation

You can start with our [Online Editor](https://app.automaduino.com/)! 

_Automaduino will soon be available for Windows Desktop here._

## What's next?

You can start by reading about the [Concepts](/docs/concepts/) or head over to the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/) guide to learn more about how to use Automaduino. 
If you need more information about how the Arduino works checkout our [Workshop](/docs/workshop/) material. There you'll find basic instructions on how to use the Arduino and worksheets to try it out!
